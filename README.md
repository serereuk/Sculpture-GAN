#To Understand the Sculpture-Gan!

# Sculpture-GAN
3D DCGAN inspired GAN trained on 32x32x32 voxelizations of [Thingi10k](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/) - a corpus of 10,000 3D printable objects and sculptures - as a result, the generated sculptures are almost always 3D-printable, but usually do not have any real 'meaning', and are just abstract sorts of shapes.

I originally began this project as an attempt at generative architecture; but lack of an appropriate dataset held me back from that. Currently working with trying to get something usable from the google sketchup 3d workshop

# Example abstract shape generations

# Usage

There are really only 3 files you need to use to generate your own 3D shapes.

## generate_dataset.py

You need to download [Thingi10k](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/), and in line 8 of generate_dataset.py, set the variable `path_to_dataset` to be the path to your `raw_meshes` folder from your thingi10k download.

Next, just run the file with `python generate_dataset.py`, and it will start generating numpy arrays that contain all of the  now-voxelized models in thingi10k and save them to your `data/` folder.

## train.py

On line 23 of `train.py`, point it to the desired (usually the largest) .npy file in your `data/` folder by setting `numpy_array_saved` equal to its path.

Then, you can just run `python train.py` and trained network checkpoints will start to populate your `network_checkpoints/` folder.

## visualize.py

Point `visualize.py` to an array of generations in your `generations` folder (an array is created every 50 epochs) by setting `array_to_visualize` equal to its path. 

This script will allow you to see the models that network has generated in 3D, with the option to save as PNG, obj, etc.

# Issues / Future efforts

Right now, the main issue is the fact that it's very hard to get data for this sort of project; the only two datasets I have encountered are shapnet and thingi10k; currently; i am trying to train a conditional version of the 3d GAN with shapenet so that you can select that you want to generate a table, chair, etc, and the network will move past just generating "shapes"...
